      <p class="adamstyling2">
        I am an aspiring web developer with experience in information technology
        and customer service. I began my working carrer serving four years in
        the Navy as an IT support technician. Upon completion of my service,
        I've held numerous IT support roles for various companies around
        Indianapolis, in addition to serving in an office administration
        position that enabled me to develop my customer relational skills and
        establish the importance of communicating in a team environment.
