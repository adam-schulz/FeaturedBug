      <p class="adamstyling2">
        I am an aspiring web developer with experience in information technology
        and customer service. I began my working carrer serving four years in
        the Navy as an IT support technician. Upon completion of my service,
        I've held numerous IT support roles for various companies around
        Indianapolis, in addition to serving in an office administration
        position that enabled me to develop my customer relational skills and
        establish the importance of communicating in a team environment.

        <p>Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately! </p>
        <p>Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course.</p>
